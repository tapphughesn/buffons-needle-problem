# buffons-needle-problem

Buffon's needle problem is the following. Suppose you have a collection of needles (line segments) and you randomly drop them onto a ruled paper. What is that chance that a needle, when it rests on the paper, will cross with one of the rule lines on the paper?

It turns out that the probability of the needle crossing the ruled line is

where *l* is the length of the needle and *d* is the distance between the ruled lines on the paper.
